**Popular Starting Locations and Destinations:**

The top trip starting location was at E 17th and Broadway, located near Union Square Park, which recorded approximately 55,500 trips.  The number one destination from this location was at E 17th and Broadway, indicating people went for a ride at Union Square Park and returned at their starting point.  Other top destinations from this point include 2 stations on the other side of the park, which shows similar behavior.  Other destinations include locations near subway stations.

**Travel Duration and Distance by Bike Type:**

Majority of the trips were from the classic bike type.  On average people who used these bikes rode for 17 minutes and traveled approximately 2 kilometers (as the crow flies) from one station to another. Docked bike trips, though fewer, were on average 21 minutes and average distance traveled was 2.1 kilometers (as the crow flies).  There were 203 electric bike trips recorded.  Of these, the trip duration was 4 minutes on average and average distance traveled was .005 kilometers.  The trip duration could be due to the speed of electric bikes or pricing.  The trip distance of electric bikes might be because people were curious about these bikes and never intended to travel far.

**Trips Over Time:**

There were huge drops in number of trips due to hurricanes,  indicating trip volume is affected by weather. Also, there were spikes in the number of trips around weekends, especially Saturdays in September, and holidays or notable days, such as September 11th, where many people visited the city in remembrance of that day.  Interestingly, immediately after Hurricane Ida hit on September 1st, there was a spike in number of trips the next day, confirming many people used bikes as a mode of transportation after many subways were flooded.

**Trips by Hour of Day:**

On weekdays there is a spike in number of trips during peak commuter hours. Interestingly, people are more likely to use another mode transportation for a morning commute (especially on a Wednesday or Friday morning) and are more likely to bike during afternoon or evening commute.  On weekends, the number of trips seems to be spread out throughout the day.

People using bikes during peak commute times are highly likely to have a Citibike membership as opposed to casual customers. This indicates that most members are using bikes to commute to work or school and back home or use bikes for exercise after work.  During peak commute hours, members tend to travel a farther distance as well.

**Membership Type:**

Majority of Citibike trips were made by members.  This further indicates that Citibike customers who are members are more likely to use bikes as a major form of transportation, especially for commuting. They might even choose to become a member for commuting or exercise.

**Conclusion:**

Citibikes are a very common way of travelling throughout the city, especially toward center city.  The number of trips is dependent on weather, weekends, holidays, and peak commute hours.  Most Citibike customers are members and are most likely to ride bikes to commute or exercise.  They are also likely to travel farther during these times. Their average trip distance is approximately 2km (as the crow flies) and travel times are roughly between 17-21 minutes on average.
